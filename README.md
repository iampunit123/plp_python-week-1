Simple Calculator (Whole Numbers)
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a simple Python-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” on whole numbers.
It is beginner-friendly, runs in the terminal, and is a great starting project for learning Python input handling and conditional logic.

ðŸš€ Features
Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)

Accepts whole numbers as input

Displays results in a clean, easy-to-read format

Handles invalid operations with an error message

ðŸ›  Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your system

A terminal or command prompt to run the program

ðŸ“¥ Installation & Setup
Clone or Download this repository to your computer.

Ensure Python 3 is installed by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python --version
Save the script as calculator.py (or any name you prefer).

â–¶ Usage
Open your terminal or command prompt in the scriptâ€™s folder.

Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python calculator.py
Enter the two whole numbers when prompted.

Enter the desired operation symbol: +, -, *, or /.

View the result instantly.

Example run:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *
10 * 5 = 50
âš  Notes
Division results will be shown as a float, even if both inputs are whole numbers.

If an invalid operation is entered, the program will display an error message and exit.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
âœ… Add support for decimal numbers

âœ… Include modulus (%) and exponentiation (^) operations

âœ… Improve error handling for invalid numeric inputs

âœ… Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

âœ… Allow continuous calculations without restarting the program
